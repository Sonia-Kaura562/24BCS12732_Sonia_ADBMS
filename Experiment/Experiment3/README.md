# Question 1: Count using CASE

## Problem Statement

Write a query to count the number of students in each department who have scored more than **80** marks. Display the department name and alias the count column as **Dept_HighScore_Count**.

## SQL Query Used

📄 [count_using_case.sql](count_using_case.sql)

## Output

## Result

The number of students scoring more than **80** marks in each department was successfully calculated using the **COUNT()** function with a **CASE** expression.

# Question 2: Employee Dataset Queries

## Problem Statement

Create an **employees** table, insert the given records, and perform SQL queries to:

- Group employees based on city.
- Display the number of employees in each city.
- Use the **HAVING** clause to filter groups.
- Sort the grouped results using the **ORDER BY** clause.

## SQL Query Used

📄 [employee_queries.sql](employee_queries.sql)

## Output

🖼️ [employee_queries.png](employee_queries.png)

## Result

The employee data was successfully grouped based on city. The **HAVING** clause was used to filter grouped records, and the results were sorted using the **ORDER BY** clause.
